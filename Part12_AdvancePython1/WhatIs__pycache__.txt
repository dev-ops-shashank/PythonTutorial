Great question! The `__pycache__` folder is a normal part of Python's operation, but it's good to 
understand what it is and how to handle it. Let's break this down:

1. What is `__pycache__`?
   - It's a directory created by Python 3.x to store compiled bytecode versions of your Python modules.
   - The files in this folder have a `.pyc` extension.

2. Why is it created?
   - Python creates these compiled files to speed up module loading.
   - When you import a module, Python checks if there's a compiled version in `__pycache__`. If it 
   exists and is up-to-date, Python uses it instead of recompiling the `.py` file.

3. How was it created automatically?
   - Python creates this folder and the `.pyc` files automatically when you run your Python scripts.
   - It happens when you import modules (like you did with `from module import myFunc`).

4. Is it safe?
   - Yes, it's completely safe. It's a standard part of Python's operation.
   - It doesn't contain any sensitive information, just compiled versions of your Python code.

5. Can you remove it?
   - Yes, you can safely remove the `__pycache__` folder and its contents.
   - Python will recreate it the next time you run your code.

6. Will removing it impact your code?
   - Removing it won't affect your code's functionality.
   - The only impact is that Python will need to recompile your modules the next time you run your 
   code, which might cause a slight delay in startup time.

7. Should you include it in version control (like Git)?
   - Generally, no. It's considered best practice to exclude `__pycache__` from version control.
   - You can add `__pycache__/` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked.

8. Can you prevent its creation?
   - You can set the environment variable `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` to a non-empty value to prevent 
   Python from creating `.pyc` files and the `__pycache__` directory.
   - You can also use the `-B` flag when running Python to achieve the same effect.

9. Python version considerations:
   - In Python 2.x, `.pyc` files were created in the same directory as the `.py` files.
   - Python 3.x introduced the `__pycache__` directory to keep things cleaner.

In summary, the `__pycache__` folder is a normal, safe part of Python's operation. You can remove it 
if you want, but it's generally best to just ignore it (especially in version control) and let Python
manage it automatically. It helps with performance and doesn't affect your actual code.
