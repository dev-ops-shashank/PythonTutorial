# Below are the Mathematical Operators used in Python
# Arithmetic Operators : -, +, *, /, //, **, etc
# Assignment Operators : =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc
# Comparison Operators : ==, >=, <=, <, >, !=, etc
# Logical Operators : and, or, not
print(12+77)    #prints 89
print(12/5)     #prints 2.4, returns float number
print(12//5)    #prints 2, return integer after removing all the numbers after decimal in result. note: this does not do the roundOff
print(3*2)      #prints 6, simply returns the multiple
print(3**2)     #prints 9, returns 3 to the power 2, Exponential

# In next SubPart, we will create a small Calculator using these operators.
