# We will Learn Variables & data types in this part
# Variable is the name given to a memory location in a program, Example:
var1 = 32
var2 = "Python"
var3 = 4.66
var4 = True

# Data types are the definition of a variable. Example:
print(type(var1))   # return the data type of Var1 = <class 'int'>
print(type(var2))   # return the data type of Var1 = <class 'str'>
print(type(var3))   # return the data type of Var1 = <class 'float'>
print(type(var4))   # return the data type of Var1 = <class 'bool'>

# There are Primarily 4 types of Data that we use most of the time. They are Integer, Float, String, Boolean.
# There are other data types also but we will learn about them later in this Tutorial

# Rules for these data types:
# Integer only contains tru postive & negative values
# Float contains all the decimals values
# String contains all the values within double quotes ""
# Boolean only have 2 values - True & False, without any quotes
