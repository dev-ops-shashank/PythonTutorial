The stubborn donkey refused to move an inch further.
Sunflowers turned their faces towards the warm sunlight.
The farmer led his trusted donkey through the field.
Stars twinkled brightly in the clear night sky.
The old donkey brayed loudly in the quiet barn.
Waves crashed against the rocky shoreline.
A rainbow appeared after the brief summer shower.
Children laughed as they played in the park.
The aroma of fresh coffee filled the kitchen.
The donkey carried heavy loads up the mountain path.
