Let's break it down:

1) If-Else Statements:
        Basic structure:
        if condition:       # code to execute if condition is True
        else:               # code to execute if condition is False
    Example:
    age = 18
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult")
    else:
        print("You are a minor")

2) Elif (Else If):
    Used for multiple conditions:
    score = 85
    if score >= 90:
        print("A")
    elif score >= 80:
        print("B")
    elif score >= 70:
        print("C")
    else:
        print("D")

3) Nested If Statements:
    x = 10
    if x > 0:
        if x < 5:
            print("Positive but less than 5")
        else:
            print("Positive and greater than or equal to 5")
    else:
        print("Non-positive")

4) Ternary Operators:
    A concise way to write simple if-else statements:
    age = 20
    status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"

5) Logical Operators:
    and: Both conditions must be True
    or: At least one condition must be True
    not: Inverts the boolean value

Example:
    x = 5
    y = 10
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        print("Both are positive")

6) Comparison Operators:
    ==: Equal to
    !=: Not equal to
    <: Less than
    >: Greater than
    <=: Less than or equal to
    >=: Greater than or equal to

7) Truthy and Falsy Values:
    Falsy values: False, None, 0, "" (empty string), [] (empty list), {} (empty dict)
    Everything else is considered Truthy

Example:
    if []:
        print("This won't print")
    if [1, 2, 3]:
        print("This will print")

8) The 'in' Operator:
    Used to check membership in sequences:
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    if "banana" in fruits:
        print("Yes, banana is a fruit!")

9) Short-circuit Evaluation:
    Python uses short-circuit evaluation with and and or:
    x = 5
    y = 0
    result = x != 0 and y / x > 2  # This won't raise a ZeroDivisionError

10) The pass Statement:
    Used as a placeholder where code will eventually go:
    if condition:
        pass  # TODO: Implement this later
    else:
        print("Condition is false")

11) Conditional Expressions in List Comprehensions:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

12) The match Statement (Python 3.10+):
    A more powerful switch-case equivalent:
    def http_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad request"
        case 404:
            return "Not found"
        case 418:
            return "I'm a teapot"
        case _:
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"


Remember, indentation is crucial in Python, especially for conditional statements. It defines the block of code that belongs to each 
condition.
These concepts form the foundation of decision-making in Python programs. As you practice, you'll find yourself combining these 
in various ways to create more complex logic in your code.
