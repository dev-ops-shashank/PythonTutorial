The `match` statement, also known as "structural pattern matching," was introduced in Python 3.10. 
It's a powerful feature that allows you to compare a value against multiple patterns and execute 
code based on which pattern matches. It's similar to switch statements in other languages but more 
powerful and flexible.
It is Similar to Switch case in Java.
Here's an overview of how `match` cases work in Python:

1. Basic Syntax:
```python
match value:
    case pattern1:
        # code for pattern1
    case pattern2:
        # code for pattern2
    case _:
        # default case (optional)
```

2. Simple Value Matching:
```python
def describe_type(value):
    match value:
        case int():
            print("It's an integer")
        case str():
            print("It's a string")
        case list():
            print("It's a list")
        case _:
            print("It's something else")

describe_type(42)        # Output: It's an integer
describe_type("hello")   # Output: It's a string
describe_type([1, 2, 3]) # Output: It's a list
describe_type(3.14)      # Output: It's something else
```

3. Pattern Matching with Conditions:
```python
def describe_number(num):
    match num:
        case 0:
            print("Zero")
        case n if n > 0:
            print("Positive number")
        case n if n < 0:
            print("Negative number")

describe_number(0)   # Output: Zero
describe_number(5)   # Output: Positive number
describe_number(-3)  # Output: Negative number
```

4. Matching Sequences:
```python
def process_point(point):
    match point:
        case (0, 0):
            print("Origin")
        case (0, y):
            print(f"Y-axis at y={y}")
        case (x, 0):
            print(f"X-axis at x={x}")
        case (x, y):
            print(f"Point at ({x}, {y})")
        case _:
            print("Not a point")

process_point((0, 0))    # Output: Origin
process_point((0, 5))    # Output: Y-axis at y=5
process_point((3, 0))    # Output: X-axis at x=3
process_point((2, 3))    # Output: Point at (2, 3)
process_point("invalid") # Output: Not a point
```

5. Matching Objects:
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

def describe_point(point):
    match point:
        case Point(x=0, y=0):
            print("Origin")
        case Point(x=0, y=y):
            print(f"Y-axis at y={y}")
        case Point(x=x, y=0):
            print(f"X-axis at x={x}")
        case Point(x=x, y=y):
            print(f"Point at ({x}, {y})")
        case _:
            print("Not a point")

describe_point(Point(0, 0))  # Output: Origin
describe_point(Point(0, 5))  # Output: Y-axis at y=5
describe_point(Point(3, 0))  # Output: X-axis at x=3
describe_point(Point(2, 3))  # Output: Point at (2, 3)
```

6. OR Patterns:
```python
def check_type(value):
    match value:
        case str() | int():
            print("String or Integer")
        case list() | tuple():
            print("List or Tuple")
        case _:
            print("Something else")

check_type("hello")  # Output: String or Integer
check_type(42)       # Output: String or Integer
check_type([1, 2])   # Output: List or Tuple
check_type({1, 2})   # Output: Something else
```

The `match` statement is particularly useful for complex branching logic, especially when dealing 
with structured data. It can make your code more readable and expressive compared to long 
chains of `if-elif` statements.

Remember, this feature is only available in Python 3.10 and later versions. If you're working 
with earlier versions, you'll need to use traditional `if-elif` statements instead.
